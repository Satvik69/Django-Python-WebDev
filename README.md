# Django-Python-WebDev
Follow me in learning about how Django and Python can create websites. A series that a bored me during quaratine was curious to learn about.

Synopsis:
During quarantine, I wanted to learn more about Python and its web development capabilities. All my friends were creating simple HTML websites, however, I wanted to make one that has its own database and applications. The following projects are all under a programming course I following titled: StackSkills Django 2 & Python | The Ultimate Web Development Bootcamp. A very interesting course that introduced me to database driven website. It eventually spurred my interest into learning and teaching SQL after my junior year in high school.

Oh yeah, did I mention this was my first time using GitHub? I feel so much smarter looking back :) .
